Usage: $PROGNAME [options] <rootfs>

Options:
 -r <repo-url>      Use this XBPS repository (may be specified multiple times).
 -c <cachedir>      Use this XBPS cache directory.
 -i <lz4|gzip|bzip2|xz> Compression type for the initramfs image (xz if unset).
 -o <file>          Output file name for the netboot tarball (auto if unset).
 -K <kernelpkg>     Use <kernelpkg> instead of 'linux' to build the image.

 -k <keymap>        Console keymap to set (us if unset)
 -l <locale>        Locale to set (en_US.UTF-8 if unset)

 -C "cmdline args"  Add additional kernel command line arguments.
 -T "title"         Modify the bootloader title.
 -S "splash image"  Set a custom splash image for the bootloader

The $PROGNAME script generates a network-bootable tarball of Void Linux
